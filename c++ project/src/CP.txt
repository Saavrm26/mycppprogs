rough range of  int -10^9 to 10^9
rough range of long int -10^12 to 10^12
rough range of long long int -10^18 to 10^18
LL is used to denote long long values.
double has high range but while storing it the values are not accurately stored.
always check the range of an expression after calcuations
{} can be used to define custom scopes
== can be used to compare strings for equality
use cin.ignore() after if getline is used after cin.
    cin>>t;
    cin.ignore();
    getline(cin,s);
this will  solve errors relating to invalid input.

don't concatenate characters with strings because they take more time(time complexity) instead use the push_back() function
    string str="abc";
    str.pushback('d');
    cout<<str;
